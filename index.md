I am a young burgeoning scientist from the Caribbean region. I am passionate about climate change and the role that Renewables have to play in mitigating against climate impacts. My work focuses on providing solutions to the renewable energy in the Caribbean region. Most recently I have been working to implement a Solar Forecasting/Nowcasting Platform, WRF-Solar and MAD-WRF for the Caribbean region. This project has created a burning desire to further understand the role that clouds play in attenuating solar radiation.

## Current Interests and Projects:

- Sustainable Energy
- Solar Forecasting/Nowcasting
- Radiative Transfer and Remote Sensing
- Improvement of Cloud Initialization in WRF
- Data Assimilation
- Numerical Modelling
- Climate Variability
- Wave Propagation
- 3D Printed Automatic Weather Stations
