I was born and raised in Portmore, Jamaica. I am passionate about climate change and the role that Renewables have to play in mitigating against climate impacts. I received my B.Sc and MPhil in Energy and Environmental Physics and Applied Physics from the University of the West Indies at Mona, Kingston Jamaica. After completing my studies I worked with Caribbean Institute for Meteorology and Hydrology, Bridgetown, Barbados, where I developed products and services for the renewable energy industry within the Caribbean Region. These products include  Solar Forecasting/Nowcasting Platforms, WRF-Solar and MAD-WRF. Currently, I am working on developing a better understanding of Tropical Cyclone induced Surface Waves.

## Current Interests and Projects:

- Ocean Surface Waves
- Tropical Cyclone Induced Surface Waves
- Sustainable Energy
- Solar Forecasting/Nowcasting
- Data Assimilation
- Numerical Modelling
- Wave Propagation
