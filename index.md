I was born and raised in Portmore, Jamaica. I am passionate about climate change and the role that Renewables play in mitigating climate impacts. I obtained my B.Sc and MPhil in Energy and Environmental Physics and Applied Physics from the University of the West Indies at Mona, Kingston Jamaica. During my MPhil program I developed a keen interest in the role ocean surface waves have to play in Jamaica's energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables. This led to me exploring the feasibility of the wave energy resources in proximity to Jamaica. After completing my studies I worked with Caribbean Institute for Meteorology and Hydrology, Bridgetown, Barbados, where I developed products and services for the renewable energy industry within the Caribbean Region. These products include  Solar Forecasting/Nowcasting Platforms, WRF-Solar and MAD-WRF. Recently, I have returned to my work with ocean surface waves. Under the guidance of Prof. Shuyi Chen, I am working to develop a better understanding of Tropical Cyclone induced Ocean Surface Waves.

## Current Interests and Projects:

- Ocean Surface Waves
- Tropical Cyclone Induced Surface Waves
- Sustainable Energy
- Solar Forecasting/Nowcasting
